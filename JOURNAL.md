## 10/4/2025 - Planning and prep  

I started by spending a few hours exploring potential options, protocols, and security solutions! This took a bit, and I ended up going down a cryptography rabbit hole exploring all of the abusrdly cool options available. In the end I decided to go for a simple design, using a USB-C plug for simplicity, and avoiding the fingerprint sensor, because the cheapest one I can find is 20$ and I need to trim the fat off of these so I can order a few for testing, in case I accidentally brick it in firmware development.
